1
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,903
Oh, lonesome night.


2
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,903
Oh, lonesome night.


3
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:46,935
And babbits bawling,
the wind biting the bone.


4
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,613
Wind like this...


5
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,412
...full of voices.


6
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,885
Ancestry howling at you...


7
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,883
...yibbering stories...


8
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:07,827
...all voices tied up into one.


9
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,628
One voice differing...


10
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,065
...one voice...


11
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:21,436
...whispering out there,
spying from the dark...


12
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:26,717
...that fangy devil...


13
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,612
...Old Georgie hisself.


14
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:35,784
Mm. Now you ear up close...


15
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:40,963
...and I'll yarn you about
the first time we met...


16
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,765
...eye to eye.

459
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:36,793
ZACHRY: Nay, this life of rotted luck
ain't no smileysome yarnie.


460
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:41,489
And rares time I ever fess
the secret of Sloosha's Hallow.


461
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:46,968
Adam, my bro'by law, and his son and me
be trekking back from Honokaa Market.


462
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:53,734
Was Adam's custom to kowtow his
ancestry with offerings and honorings.


463
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,150
Suddenwise...


464
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,979
...that fangy devil's eyes, I felt them.


466
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,187
ZACHRY:
Who there?


467
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,991
MAN:
Zachry.


468
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,064
Oh....


469
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:24,497
A darky spot you're in, friend.


470
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:25,700
Old Georgie?


471
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:29,711
Ain't no blade can protect you
from the True-true.


472
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,481
BOY:
Pa!


473
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,446
Jonas! Jonas, go! Go, go!


474
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,419
Zachry!


475
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,820
Zachry? Zachry!


477
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,933
Stay here.


478
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,768
Safe here.


479
00:32:58,543 --> 00:32:59,532
Zachry!


481
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:07,079
Kona'll be feasting on Adam
and his boy by sunup.


482
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,479
ADAM:
Zachry!


483
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,285
No! Nay!


484
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,047
Zachry!


485
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:13,622
Zachry!


486
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,816
You say all'a time, yeah?


487
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:19,962
"The weak are meat,
the strong do eat"?


488
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,759
Father! Aah! Unh.


489
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,993
No! Jonas!


490
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,071
OLD GEORGIE:
The True-true is what that is.


491
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:49,959
ZACHRY: Whole Valley whispering about
the blood of Adam and his son on my hands.


492
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:53,359
But Rose and Catkin never believed
no yibbering, and stood by me.


493
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,961
Uncle Zach, look!


494
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,561
Yeah, I see them.


495
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,737
Prescients come bartering twice a year...


496
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,272
...their ships creep-crawling on waves...


497
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,468
...just floating on
the Smart of the Old Uns.


498
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,011
Barter'll be starting soon.


499
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,443
Yeah.


500
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,782
You must go find your ma.


503
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,093
What're you doing?


504
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,130
Ma says ya ain't been right
since Sloosha's.


505
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,436
Say I gotta keep eyewise on ya.


506
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,433
You minding me while I mind the goats.


507
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,505
I see.


508
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,815
Stump is, who's gonna mind your ma
at the Barter?


509
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,844
She got no tongue for haggling,
not like you and me.


510
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,214
Sure you're all right?


511
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,117
Swear'by. Be home for supping.


512
00:34:56,127 --> 00:35:00,188
Why words slink'n slide off'a tongue
when we need them most?


513
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,630
If my tongue been more bold...


514
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,998
...could I'a stop all the diresomes
about to happen?


515
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,064
CATKIN:
Uncle Zach!


516
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,038

00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,004
Spesh guest hosting.


519
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:19,445
Thank you for the kindsome host
of my Valley stay.


520
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,517
I ain't yaysoed this, Rose.


521
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,218
Abbess sayso a gift of great honor.


522
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:25,855
She can be hosting then.


523
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,256
I bring you gift, Zachry.


524
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,458
Need no gift from a stranger.


525
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,202
ZACHRY: Now kin 'n bros 'n half-strangers,
even the Abbess...


526
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,305
...all come knocking...


527
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:46,637
...to gape in wonderment, like Sonmi herself
were sitting in our kitchen.


528
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:51,581
Questions about Prescience and their
woahsome ship poured thick 'n fast.


529
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:54,411
How your ship slide 'n glide
so silentsome?


530
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,710
Fusion engines.


531
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,519
No one queried what
"fusion engines" was...


532
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:03,182
...because they didn't want to look stupid
front of the gathering.


533
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,918
Fusion engines.


534
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,665
True really was,
Meronym answer the questions...


535
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,597
...but no answer ever quenched
your curio.


536
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:15,296
All that answering done was teached
everyone fo not trust her.


537
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,464
Nay, not a flea.


538
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,042
She a sly one.


539
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:25,040
Scheming and worming herself in.


540
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,308
Watch her, watch her close.


541
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,954
She's got secrets.


546
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,398
-Zachry Bailey!
-Sorrysome for waking you, Abbess.


547
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,168
I dream something
diresome's gonna happen.


548
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,606
Come in, come in.


549
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:33,305
ABBESS:
Oh, let Sonmi guide your heart.


550
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:39,380
Oh, I can hear her voice a'prayin’ for you.


551
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,922
Oh, Old Georgie's a'hungerin'
for your soul.


552
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,029
Oh. I know'd it.


553
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,957
-Spit'n cuss on your dreams.
-l know'd it.


555
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:59,338
"Bridge a'broken’, hide below.


556
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,143
Hands'a'bleedin’, can't let go.


557
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,511
Enemy's sleeping, don't slit that throat."


559
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,345
An auguring.


560
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,181
Oh, Zachry.


561
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,984
Trust Sonmi.


562
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:24,767
Keep Her warning with you.
Nail it to your memory.


563
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,331
Thank you. Thank you, Abbess.


564
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:30,763
Thank you.


705
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,644
WOMAN:
I found an old Transway marker, captain.


706
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,577
It's got to be the right mountain.


707
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:30,979
Problem is, the Valley people
are afraid of it.


708
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,782
They think the devil lives up there.


709
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:36,952
I can't find anybody to guide me
through the Kona territory.


710
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,151
Meronym...


712
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,522
...every day you are out there,
you increase your RAD levels.


713
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:45,133
This dream of yours is going to kill you.


714
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:49,705
And for what? The off-world colonies
may no longer exist.


715
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:51,062
I gotta go, captain.


753
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:00,556
How is it'n, Zachry?


754
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:02,323
Samewise.


755
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:04,292
MERONYM:
Mindin' some comp'ny?


756
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,689
ZACHRY:
Nay.


757
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:10,866
But goats'n surlywise herders
ain't known for our howziting temper.


758
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:18,340
Feelin' I ownin' you a real kowtow
for 'vadin' y'house with no sayso.


759
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,365
True sorrysome.


760
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:23,738
Fuggit, done's done.


761
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:28,147
MERONYM: So, you mindin' a stranger
queryin' ‘bout your troddin'?


762
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:32,286
Swap you, query for query.


763
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:35,918
Fair'by.


764
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:40,454
Cog y'ain't come t'learn stitchin'
or milking or herding.


765
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:43,559
Why you here?


766
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:46,596
I needing a guide.


767
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,639
Guide? To what?


768
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,666
Mauna Sol.


769
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:03,348
ABBESS:
"Bridge a'broken, hide below."


770
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:06,644
What's wrong?


783
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:22,759
The auguring come true, Abbess.
Broke bridge just like you say.


784
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:25,833
Meronym were there yibbering
about trekking up Mauna Sol...


785
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:29,199
...horses'pess’'n, woman come
cussing n'twisting up my life?


786
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,033
Mind the Words o'Sonmi.


868
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,079
-Abbess, come quick. It's the Bailey girl.
-Catkin?


869
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:13,840
Aye. She dying.


870
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:19,688
-What happened?
ROSE: Zach!


871
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:25,855
-Sonmi....
-The scorpion fish.


872
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:28,896
Healer say she be gone by sundown.


873
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:32,266
Ain't right, ain't fair
but nothing to be done.


881
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,580
Catkin's dying!


882
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,589
-What?
-Trod on a scorpion fish.


883
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:35,956
You can save her. You got spesh smarts
in that gearbag what'll save her.


884
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,690
That's the True-true.


885
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,698
Prescient Council swear
by special order...


886
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:44,168
...say I can't go play Lady Sonmi
for every fate twistin' wrong...


887
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,807
...n" click fingers make right.


888
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:50,139
I just a stupid goat herder, but I cog
you killin' Catkin by not acting...


889
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:53,612
...just as if I left you up on that bridge,
you Kona meat.


890
01:00:55,918 --> 01:01:00,150
If a Prescient be laying with poison
melting her heart'n'lungs...


891
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:02,151
...If it be your kin?


892
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:06,560
Why's a Prescient's life
worth more'n a Valleysman?


893
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:17,570
I'll take you to Mauna Sol.


894
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,165
I know the way.


895
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:22,711
If you save Catkin...


896
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,172
...I will guide you through the devil's door
if that's where you want to go.


925
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:51,816
Mama?


926
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:54,020
Huh?


927
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:56,355
I hungry.


929
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,632
ROSE:
Oh, baby.


1234
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:41,499
Something praying on you, Zachry?


1235
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:45,366
You really ain't feary 'bout meetin'
Old Georgie on the summit?


1236
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,771
More scaresome ‘bout the weather
than any devil.


1237
01:25:52,413 --> 01:25:54,074
You cog he's real?


1238
01:25:54,849 --> 01:25:57,682
Who tripped the Fall,
if not Old Georgie?


1239
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:01,348
True-true?


1240
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:06,659
The Old Uns.


1241
01:26:07,762 --> 01:26:09,662
That's jus' a rope o' smoke.


1242
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:12,196
Old Uns got the Smart.


1243
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:15,429
They mastered sick and seeds...


1244
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:18,098
...mak'd mir‘cles 'n fly ‘cross the sky.


1245
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:21,436
True. All true.
But they got somethin' else.


1246
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:26,313
A hunger'n their hearts,
hunger that's stronger'n all their Smart.


1247
01:26:27,782 --> 01:26:29,716
Hunger? For what?


1248
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:33,282
A hunger for more.


1392
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,193
Okay.


1393
01:37:25,729 --> 01:37:28,892
Sussin' them clouds, we run out time.


1394
01:37:32,603 --> 01:37:35,572
Hey, don't need no smart rope.


1395
01:37:35,939 --> 01:37:37,201
Yea.


1396
01:37:37,374 --> 01:37:40,434
See you fall, I catch you.


1414
01:38:55,085 --> 01:39:01,422
You treddn' on the Devil's ground now,
Vall'ysman.


1415
01:39:03,293 --> 01:39:09,357
I'm sayin’ jus' once.
That offlander ain't gettin' to the top.


1416
01:39:10,868 --> 01:39:14,497
Time for you to let go of that rope.


1417
01:39:14,671 --> 01:39:19,131
You trespass, you pay the price.


1418
01:39:20,410 --> 01:39:22,503
Now drop that rope.


1419
01:39:22,913 --> 01:39:24,904
Drop that rope!


1420
01:39:25,115 --> 01:39:26,514
Drop that rope!


1435
01:40:27,945 --> 01:40:29,742
OLD GEORGIE:
Now drop that rope.


1436
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:33,047
Let go of that rope! Let go of that rope!


1437
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:36,248
ABBESS: Hands'a'bleedin’, can't let go.
OLD GEORGIE: Let go.


1438
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:37,478
ZACHRY:
Hands'a'bleedin’...


1439
01:40:37,688 --> 01:40:40,714
ABBESS: Can't let go.
-..don't let go. No.


1441
01:40:53,804 --> 01:40:55,294
Thank you, Zachry.


1442
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:58,908
You saving me twicely now.


1443
01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:01,935
You fall, I'll catch you.


1479
01:45:19,069 --> 01:45:21,867
ZACHRY:
Nay, the dead never stay dead.


1480
01:45:26,042 --> 01:45:30,206
Open your ears 'n they never
stop a'yibberin'.


1481
01:45:45,128 --> 01:45:46,356
What is this place?


1482
01:45:47,998 --> 01:45:52,901
Before the Fall,
Old Uns built dwellings...


1483
01:45:53,904 --> 01:45:57,635
...beyond the sky,
among the stars, and...


1484
01:45:58,875 --> 01:46:02,902
...this place joined here with there.


1485
01:46:12,422 --> 01:46:13,912
Sonmi....


1486
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:21,461
'Tis she.


1487
01:46:22,432 --> 01:46:25,595
The Old Uns prayed to Senmi
same as Valleysmen?


1488
01:46:26,803 --> 01:46:30,466
Nay, not ‘cisely same.


1505
01:48:02,666 --> 01:48:05,260
What'd you mean down there, ‘bout...


1506
01:48:05,435 --> 01:48:10,202
...the Old Uns and Valleysmen
prayin' to Sonmi, not ‘cisely the same?


1507
01:48:12,075 --> 01:48:15,067
I mean, they were differing.


1508
01:48:17,013 --> 01:48:18,207
Differing.


1509
01:48:18,882 --> 01:48:19,871
How?


1510
01:48:23,153 --> 01:48:24,882
You want the True-true?


1514
01:48:51,381 --> 01:48:53,315
MERONYM:
Sonmi weren't no god.


1515
01:48:53,683 --> 01:48:58,552
She died hundreds of years ago
on a faraway pen'sula deadlanded now.


1516
01:48:59,789 --> 01:49:00,778
What?


1517
01:49:01,725 --> 01:49:03,056
I cog Valleysman b'liefs'.


1518
01:49:03,226 --> 01:49:07,219
I know Abbess teach'd you Sonmi was
a mir'cle, birthed o' Darwin Ged o' Smart...


1519
01:49:07,397 --> 01:49:09,331
...but ain't the True-true.


1520
01:49:09,499 --> 01:49:11,160
OLD GEORGIE:
Lies.


1521
01:49:11,334 --> 01:49:13,427
Her life was sad 'n judased.


1522
01:49:13,603 --> 01:49:16,128
She died tryin' to change
the Old-Uns thinkin'.


1523
01:49:16,306 --> 01:49:20,265
Lies, nothin' but lies.


1524
01:49:21,644 --> 01:49:23,805
Nay, nay, you're lyin'.


1526
01:49:38,795 --> 01:49:40,126
Sonmi?


1527
01:49:41,097 --> 01:49:44,294
'Fore she died, she spoke
of her acts 'n' deedins.


1528
01:49:44,467 --> 01:49:48,369
Her words a heartsake blessin'
minder'me what's the True-true.


1529
01:49:48,538 --> 01:49:50,199
How long you lissin t'this?!


1530
01:49:50,373 --> 01:49:53,638
How long you jus' stand there
an' let a stranger...


1531
01:49:53,810 --> 01:49:58,304
...keep fuckin' your b'liefs up ‘n down,
and in 'n out?!


1534
01:50:06,856 --> 01:50:08,153
MERONYM:
Zachry.


1535
01:50:09,392 --> 01:50:10,757
You o'right?


1536
01:50:12,061 --> 01:50:13,619
Finish your sussin'.


1556
01:51:20,230 --> 01:51:26,396
Oh, yeah, you ain't let go that rope
cause you a lustin'...


1557
01:51:26,569 --> 01:51:29,732
...for that darkly, sweet'meat.


1558
01:51:30,073 --> 01:51:31,870
Ah, cog it all now.


1559
01:51:32,041 --> 01:51:36,137
This whore, with her cokeynut skin...


1560
01:51:36,346 --> 01:51:39,782
...'n her slywise mask,
smilin' n wormin' her way...


1561
01:51:39,949 --> 01:51:41,940
...so you trust n bring her here...


1562
01:51:42,352 --> 01:51:46,413
...scavin n sivvin for what?


1563
01:51:46,589 --> 01:51:48,216
For what, fool?


1564
01:51:49,092 --> 01:51:52,084
They want the island.


1565
01:51:52,262 --> 01:51:54,059
Prescients want it all.


1566
01:51:54,230 --> 01:51:59,930
You judasing your kin for a piece of ass.


1567
01:52:00,136 --> 01:52:03,071
She ain't your tribe!
She ain't even your color!


1568
01:52:03,239 --> 01:52:06,333
This Jezebel ignores
your yarns and ways...


1569
01:52:06,509 --> 01:52:10,605
...spinnin‘ and spoutin' her whoahsome lies,
and you lap it up like a dog in heat!


1570
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:11,804
It ain't true.


1571
01:52:11,981 --> 01:52:13,642
Ain't it? Then do sumthin’, stop her!


1572
01:52:13,816 --> 01:52:15,875
Take your spiker and...


1573
01:52:16,052 --> 01:52:17,986
[IN DEEP DISTORTED VOICE]
...slit her throat.


1574
01:52:19,022 --> 01:52:21,991
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Protect your tribe!
Protect your sis and little Catkin!


1575
01:52:22,158 --> 01:52:25,150
Kill her now 'fore it's too late!


1611
01:54:44,634 --> 01:54:46,727
Unh! Can't cog it.


1612
01:54:46,903 --> 01:54:50,361
Words and worrins like a wasp's nest
poke'd and prod'd by you!


1613
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:54,067
You come elbowing in my life,
yibberin' about the True-true...


1614
01:54:54,243 --> 01:54:56,336
...an' never telling the whole true.


1615
01:54:56,546 --> 01:54:58,275
I need to cog what you're doing!


1616
01:54:58,681 --> 01:55:01,946
I told you. I come to send a plea o'help.


1617
01:55:02,318 --> 01:55:03,910
Help, why?


1618
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:05,678
To steal our land?


1619
01:55:05,855 --> 01:55:07,914
To kill and slave us all?
What you want?!


1620
01:55:18,267 --> 01:55:21,794
Prescients dyin’, Zachry.
Jus' like Catkin.


1621
01:55:22,472 --> 01:55:25,498
This world poisoned me and all my kin.


1622
01:55:25,842 --> 01:55:28,970
We get no help,
find no home offland away.


1623
01:55:29,345 --> 01:55:33,213
I sayso truesome, we not s'vive.


1624
01:55:34,317 --> 01:55:35,978
We not s'vive.


1648
01:57:12,215 --> 01:57:13,944
Cross your fingers and toes.


1649
01:58:03,399 --> 01:58:05,367
If your prayer be answered...


1650
01:58:06,502 --> 01:58:09,266
...will Prescients never return
to the Valley again?


1651
01:58:13,409 --> 01:58:17,368
Those wishin' to come with us
be welcome.


1652
01:58:20,249 --> 01:58:21,910
The Valley is my home.


1903
02:17:27,962 --> 02:17:29,452
What was that?


1904
02:17:29,631 --> 02:17:31,599
Kona war cry.


1905
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:33,465
Zachry!


1906
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:40,530
Oh, no, no, Sonmi, no!


1907
02:17:41,543 --> 02:17:42,908

1922
02:19:51,573 --> 02:19:52,835
Nay.


1923
02:20:12,327 --> 02:20:13,760
No.


1925
02:20:15,830 --> 02:20:16,819
Nay.


1926
02:20:19,601 --> 02:20:21,228
Rose.


1927
02:20:21,970 --> 02:20:22,959
Rose.


1929
02:21:21,663 --> 02:21:25,155
ABBESS:
Enemy's sleeping, don't slit that throat.


1949
02:23:55,950 --> 02:23:59,010
Oh. Oh. Here, here, Catkin.


1950
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:03,547
Oh. Oh, Catkin. Oh.


1953
02:24:10,431 --> 02:24:12,331
-Shh.
-No.


1968
02:26:13,654 --> 02:26:16,122
Zachry.


1970
02:26:19,660 --> 02:26:20,684
CATKIN:
Unc'a Zach!


1971
02:26:28,769 --> 02:26:30,794
ZACHRY:
Hide, hide!


1972
02:26:50,891 --> 02:26:52,017
ADAM:

1973
02:26:52,460 --> 02:26:54,860
No! No! No!


1974

You kill chief. Now you meat.


1985
02:28:03,230 --> 02:28:04,356
ZACHRY:

1986
02:28:04,765 --> 02:28:06,562
-Safe now.
CATKIN: Unc'a Zach!


1987
02:28:06,767 --> 02:28:08,894
Safe, safe now.


1988
02:28:13,407 --> 02:28:14,874
